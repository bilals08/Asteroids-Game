The game starts with a spaceship at the center of the screen, surrounded by a number of randomly generated asteroids. The player must use the arrow keys to move the spaceship around the screen while avoiding obstacles and shooting the asteroids. The space bar is used to fire weapons at the asteroids.

The objective of the game is to destroy all the asteroids to complete a level. As the player progresses through the levels, the game gets harder, with more and faster asteroids appearing on the screen.

The graphics and sound in the game are designed to provide a fun and challenging arcade-style gaming experience that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
